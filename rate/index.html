                <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500; " >Rates and Fees:</span> <br>
                Our services are totally free to you! We do not charge any fees for connecting you with lenders. We do not provide loans and we do not have any influence over the rates and terms of our lenders. Since Fair Loans is not a lender, we are not able to provide you with information on actual rates, fees, and APR (annual percentage rates) with the loan you may receive. Rates and terms of loans may vary by state and by lender. After connecting you with a lender, and the loan is approved, the interest rates and fees that you will incur during repayment will be provided to you. This is a requirement of the Truth in Lending Act. If you agree to the rates and fees, the lender will direct you to an e-signature page, and your loan will be processed.
            </p>

                <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500; "> Implications of Non-Payment</span> <br>
                
                Some lenders may automatically roll over your existing loan for an additional two weeks if you don't pay back the loan on time. Fees for renewing the loan differ between lender. Usually these fees equal the fees you paid to get the initial payday loan. We insist that our lenders follow legal and ethical collection practices set by industry associations and government agencies. Please note that non-payment of a payday loan may adversely affect your credit rating.

                Disclosure of Terms

                The lender will provide you with a detailed document showing all of the terms of the loan. This will include the rates and fees that you will be responsible for. We recommended you carefully read through all the terms of the loan before making a final decision. If you are happy with the terms, you will be directed to a page requiring your e-signature.

                Fees, and terms are directly decided on by the lender, we are not responsible for any of the terms presented to you. Our Service simply connects you with a lender and we are not knowledgeable of any terms of the loan offered to you. If you are not happy with the loan terms please do not proceed with the lender.

                <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500; "> Implications of Late Payments</span> <br>
                
                Each lender in our network has their own policy when it comes to late payments. Before you agree to a loan you will be provided with the information regarding the implications of making late payments. Be sure that you understand the policy before you e-sign for a loan. Each state has rules and regulations in place that payday lenders must follow when assessing fees for late payments. Implications of Non-Payment: Some lenders may automatically roll over your existing loan for an additional two weeks if you don't pay back the loan on time. Fees for renewing the loan differ between lenders. Usually these fees equal the fees you paid to get the initial payday loan. We insist that our lenders follow legal and ethical collection practices set by industry associations and government agencies. Please note that non-payment of a payday loan may adversely affect your credit rating.

                Extending the repayment terms of a loan may result in additional interest paid, as well as late fees, which can significantly increase the total amount you pay back on a loan. In most cases the loan renewal policies are regulated by the state government.
